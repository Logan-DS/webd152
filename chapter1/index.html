    <p>My favorite beverage is lemonade. Unlike other drinks, this is associated with cooling down over the summer, and the refreshing taste is one I just adore. For me, nothing can beat a ice cold lemonade on a hot summer day. I also just like the taste of lemons, so maybe that just says something.</p>
